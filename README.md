# camomile-polymer-client

## Specifications

![specifications](specifications.jpg)

The objective of this project is to define [web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/) using [polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
to make it easier to create camomile clients.

An example of use of these components is in file [index.html](index.html)

## Implementation

Polymer 2.0 will be used to implement these components.

[polymer 2.0 quick start](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/start/quick-tour) explains that polymer components are defined as classes.
So defining the needed components for camomile will consist in defining the relevant classes.

## Installation

Install polymer https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/start/install-2-0 :

* npm install -g bower
* npm install -g polymer-cli@next
* bower install Polymer/polymer#^2.0.0-rc.7
* polymer serve
